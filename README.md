Gwallpaper
=========

**A simple GTK3 clone of Nitrogen.**

Gwallpaper is a simple clone of Nitrogen, written in C with GTK3. Currently, it has less features and
does not even set your wallpaper correctly. This means that you probably do not want to use this on a
production system yet (as far as setting a background there is important, but you know what I mean).

Installation
------------

There are two dependencies required to compile and run Gwallpaper: gdk-pixbuf2 and, of course, GTK3.

Once those dependencies are installed, just run these commands to build and install Gwallpaper:

    $ make
    # make install
    (Optionally) $ make clean
