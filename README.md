Phosphorus
=========

**A simple wallpaper browser and setter**

Phosphorus is a simple wallpaper browser and setter. Consider it a GTK3 clone of Nitrogen.
Currently, it has less features and it not yet released as stable. 
This means that you probably do not want to use this on a production system yet
(as far as setting a background there is important, but you know what I mean).

Installation
------------

There are two dependencies required to compile and run Phosphorus: GdkPixbuf and, of course, GTK3.
On Debian, these are `libgdk-pixbuf2.0-dev` and `libgtk-3-dev`.
On Arch Linux, these are `gdk-pixbuf2` and `gtk3`.

Once those dependencies are installed, just run these commands to build and install Phosphorus:

    $ autoreconf -i
    $ ./configure
    $ make
    # make install
    (Optionally) $ make clean
